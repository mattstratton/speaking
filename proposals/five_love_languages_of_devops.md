# The Five Love Languages of DevOps

The title of this session is inspired by the self-help book _The Five Love Languages_ by Gary Chapman, but the similarities end there. When we are working to bring about cultural change in our organization, it’s essential for us to understand that not everyone speaks the same “language” of DevOps as we do. The CFO has different drivers and communication style than your friend in the QA department, who is still different than the DBA in that remote office. In this talk, I will work to help provide techniques and strategies for identifying the drivers of your peers and decision-makers. We will talk about beliefs, perceptions, and communication styles, all with the express intent of helping YOU drive home the value of the DevOps philosophies and work-practices to make your organization succeed!
