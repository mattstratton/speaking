# Shifting Left Securely

Traditionally, we attempt to ensure stability by reducing the vectors that can make changes to a system. In practice, that means "deployments are executed by trusted individuals with admin access".

Automating quality test is just the start - automated and reported security and compliance testing is the way to go.
