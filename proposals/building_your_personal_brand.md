# Building Your Personal Brand

Want to be a change agent inside your organization? Your "personal brand" is a critical factor in your success. Being considered relevant both inside and outside of your organization gives weight to your opinions and recommendations, and will directly influence the impact you have.

In this talk, I'll explain methods on growing your brand, without self-aggrandizing boasts or claims of "thought leadership". You will learn how to promote the strengths you already have and strategies for marketing YOU, in a way that's authentic to YOU.

Even if you suffer from imposter syndrome or a fear of bragging, you can learn how to build your brand in an honest, genuine way.  Your results will come to fruition through your own career momentum as you experience the positive effects of influencing your organization and industry.
