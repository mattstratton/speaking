# Building Your Personal Brand

Want to be a change agent inside your organization? Your "personal brand" can have a major impact on your success. Being considered relevant both inside and outside of your organization gives weight to your opinions and recommendations, and can directly influence the impact you have.

In this talk, I'll explain methods on growing your brand, without self-aggrandizing boasts or claims of "thought leadership". You will learn how to promote the strengths you already have and strategies for marketing YOU, in a safe and comfortable manner.

Even if you suffer from imposter syndrome or a fear of bragging, you can learn how to build your brand in an honest, genuine way, and see the results in your own career momentum and influence in your organization and industry.
