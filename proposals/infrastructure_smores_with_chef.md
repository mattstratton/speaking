# Making Infrastructure S'mores with Chef

When definining the configuration of a system, different domain experts in your organization can bring their own skills and knowledge to mix together to create a delightful recipe for success. In this talk, I will demonstrate how to mix together the graham cracker of a sysadmin, the chocolate of an app dev, and the marshmallow of security to create a delicious treat that meets all the requirements for each discipline.

With the use of Test Driven Infrastructure and a Delivery Pipeline, you'll learn how each "chef" can add their portion of the camping delight, but still keep from dropping marshamllows into the campfire.
